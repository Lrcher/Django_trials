					<hr>
					<p>After insistig on trying to learn in russian which is its own headache ive decided to do it myself and well here we are!  I conviced my cousin to let me make him a website and tada, also i refused to let my self have a group, thus again here i am!</p>

					<p>Before I knew it I did his site and was falling down the rabbit hole just trying to get more out of it! Now it seems unconsisly i want them all, i want to be a fullstack dev</p>

					<p>From this you’ll see that I’m someone that jumps before I can talk myself out of doing something scary.</p>
